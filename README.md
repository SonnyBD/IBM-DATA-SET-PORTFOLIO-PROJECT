A machine learning–driven People Analytics project that identifies employees at risk of leaving and explains the drivers behind attrition. Built to support HR teams in making proactive, data-informed retention decisions.

## 🧠 Objective

To build a calibrated, interpretable predictive model using HR data that estimates employee attrition risk, uncovers key retention factors, and segments employees into actionable risk tiers for HR intervention.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, SHAP)
- XGBoost Classifier + Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Probability calibration (Platt scaling)
- SHAP for model explainability
- Matplotlib for visualizations

---

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

1. Data cleaning and feature engineering  
2. Class balancing using SMOTE  
3. Feature selection with RFE  
4. XGBoost model tuning and probability calibration  
5. Risk scoring and percentile-based tiering (Low, Moderate, High)  
6. SHAP-based interpretation of feature importance  
7. Final outputs: Excel reports, risk segmentation, and SHAP visualizations

---

## 📈 Key Results

- ✅ **88% model accuracy**
- 🎯 **Improved recall** for identifying leavers (minimized false negatives)
- 🔍 **Top predictors**: Overtime, Promotion Rate, Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction
- ⚠️ **10% of employees flagged as high risk** using calibrated thresholds

---

## 📆 Why This Matters

- 📉 Replacing a lost employee can cost ~33% of their annual salary
- ⏱️ Manual retention tracking is inefficient and reactive
- 🧠 This model helps HR prioritize who to retain and why — with explainability

> Empower HR teams with data-backed decisions instead of gut-feeling.
